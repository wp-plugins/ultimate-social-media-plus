Super-easy to use and 100% FREE social media plugin which adds social media icons to your website with tons of customization features! 

== Description ==

This plugin is based on https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/, giving it even more functions and making it even easier to use at the same time.  

It's still 100% FREE and allows you to display social media icons on your website and tailor them to your needs. 

You can add icons for RSS, Email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, Pinterest, Instagram, Youtube, "Share" (covering 200+ other social media platforms) and upload custom icons of your choice. 

Additional features in this plugin: 

- You can place icons also before posts 
- You can place the icons next to your posts also on your homepage
- You can also choose to display the icons you picked before/after posts (not just a standard set)
- Placing the icons is easier than before (new third question) 
- Several bugs fixed

As with its predecessor, you can: 

- Pick from 16 different designs for your icons
- Give several actions to one icon (e.g. your facebook icon can lead visitors to your Facebook page, and also give visitors the opportunity to like your page)
- Decide to give your icons an animation (e.g. automatic shuffling, mouse-over effects) to make your visitors aware of them, increasing the chance that they follow/share your blog
- Allow visitors to subscribe to your blog by Email 
- Add "counts" to your icons
- Decide to display a pop-up (on all or only on selected pages) asking people to follow/share you
- Select from many other customization features

The plugin is very easy to use as it takes you through the process step by step. Check out the screenshots. 


== Installation ==
Extract the zip file and drop the contents into the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation. Then activate the plugin from the plugins page.

Then go to plugin settings page and answer the first 3 questions. That's it. 

Note: This plugin requires CURL to be activated/installed on your server (which should be the standard case). If you don't have it, please contact your hosting provider.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Some of the links I entered don't work =

Please don't forget to enter the "http://" at the beginning of the link. 

= How can I change the "Please follow & like us :)" if I placed the icons via a widget? =

You can change that in the Widget-area where you dropped the widget on the sidebar. Please click on it (on the sidebar), it will open the menu where you can change the text. 

For you visual people: http://screencast.com/t/euuqTzbJ 

If you don't want to show any text, just enter a space (" ").

= How can I remove the credit-link ("Powered by Ultimatelysocial")? =

Open the first question in the plugin ("1. Where do you want to display the icons?"), on the level of the email-icon you see a link on the right hand side. Please click it to remove the credit link. 

Please note that we didn't place the credit link without your consent (you agreed to it when de-selecting the email-icon).

= Can I also display the icons vertically (on top of each other)? =

Yes. For that please go to question 5 and select to display only 1 icon per row. 

= I have difficulties uploading custom icons - why is that? = 

Most likely that's because you've set "allow_url_fopen" to "off". Please turn it to "on" (or ask your server admin to do so - he'll know what to do). 

= My Youtube icon doesn't work = 

Please ensure that you've selected the radio button "Username" when you enter a youtube username, or "Channel ID" when you entered a channel ID. 

= Aligning the icons (centered, left- or right-aligned) doesn't work = 

The alignment options under question 6 align the icons with respect to each other (see http://screencast.com/t/VPkmjs3oV ), not where they appear on the page. 

To make the icons show up at the right spot please play around with all the different placement options the plugin offers (under question 3). If that doesn't work please ask the creator of your template for advice.

= This is a great plugin! How can I say "Thank you"? = 

By giving us a 5-star rating :) You can give your "Thank you" even more strength with a donation - check the "Donate to this plugin" on the right hand side)

= Are you guys open for taking on client work? = 

Yes, absolutely. We build websites (incl. design), web applications and software, plugins :) and do theme customizations. Get in touch with us at support at ultimatelysocial dot com.
