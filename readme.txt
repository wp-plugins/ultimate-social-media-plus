Super-easy to use and 100% FREE social media plugin which adds social media icons to your website with tons of customization features! 

== Description ==

This plugin is based on https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/, giving it even more functions and making it even easier to use at the same time.  

It's still 100% FREE and allows you to display social media icons on your website and tailor them to your needs. 

You can add icons for RSS, Email, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, Pinterest, Instagram, Youtube, "Share" (covering 200+ other social media platforms) and upload custom icons of your choice. 

Additional features in this plugin: 

- You can place icons also before posts 
- You can place the icons next to your posts also on your homepage
- You can also choose to display the icons you picked before/after posts (not just a standard set)
- Placing the icons is easier than before (new third question) 
- Several bugs fixed

As with its predecessor, you can: 

- Pick from 16 different designs for your icons
- Give several actions to one icon (e.g. your facebook icon can lead visitors to your Facebook page, and also give visitors the opportunity to like your page)
- Decide to give your icons an animation (e.g. automatic shuffling, mouse-over effects) to make your visitors aware of them, increasing the chance that they follow/share your blog
- Allow visitors to subscribe to your blog by Email 
- Add "counts" to your icons
- Decide to display a pop-up (on all or only on selected pages) asking people to follow/share you
- Select from many other customization features

The plugin is very easy to use as it takes you through the process step by step. Check out the screenshots. 


== Installation ==
